# HCMUT_PPL_MT22

## MT22 language likes Pascal, it also has some special features: 
- Auto type like C++ for variables, parameters, functions.
- Pass by value-result scheme thanks to "out" keyword in parameter declararion.
- Inheritance parameter feature: Child function can inherit param from parent function by a default function "super(\<list of expr\>)" that assign parent inherit param to each expr correspondingly, or can deactivate this feature with "preventDefault()".
- Multi-dimensional array: It's hard to manipulate in Intemediate CodeGenerator assignment.
## Good luck for you all to pass this subject by only 1 time.
